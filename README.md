# Weather app
Weather app made with HTML, CSS and Javascript using an [Open Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) with basic knowledge of fetch(). 

## How It Works
The project consists of a search bar. The user enters the desired city into the input field and clicks on the search button. On hitting the search button we first verify if such a city exists in the database. If the city entered is not valid, error message is displayed, saying – “No city found.”

In case, the city exits, we display the weather information for that particular city. This information includes:

* `-City name`
- `-temperature`
- `-weather icon`
- `maximum temperature`
- `minimum temperature`
